                <h1>U.S. Army Mortar / Grappling Hook Launcher</h1>
                <h2>Technology Level III</h2>
                <p class="description"><b>Description:</b>  It consists of a metal tube, an attachable circular metal base and a bipod stabilizer. It's overall length is about 130 centimeters and it weighs over 40 kilograms empty. It can fire three different types of 81 millimeter mortar rounds (listed below) or the grappling hook assembly. The grappling hook, the shell used to launch it, and the rope attached to the grappling hook are usually packed as one kit. When used with the grappling hook, the mortar can fire the hook and rope up cliffs, across rivers, and so on. The hook then catches on the ridge or branches and is drawn tight, providing instant access up a plateau, across a roaring river; etc. </p>
                <p class="background"> <b>Background:</b> This is the M29 American Mortar used by the U.S. Army in the last days of the war.  </p>
                <p class="Rules"> <b>Rules:</b> The mortar can be assembled in five turns if the user knows how. While three characters can work together to fire two rounds per turn, a single character can use the set-up mortar alone to fire one round per turn. The grappling hook assembly takes five turns to set up before firing.<br>


                <i>High Explosive Round:</i> This round covers a 34 meter radius when it explodes, causing explosive damage to all in the area (Dm = 8). Its range is around 4,500 meters. Its attack rank is 12 + IN modifiers for targeting purposes. It cannot be fired at a target fewer than 50 meters away. It can be set to explode on contact or after a few seconds' delay so it can penetrate a target. <br>

                <i>Parachute Flare Round:</i> This round explodes in the air, releasing a parachute tied to a magnesium flare. The fuse can be delayed from l to 100 seconds. The flare then floats down, lighting up the sky and landscape for 75 seconds with almost daylight intensity. This round can be fired from 90 to 2100 meters away. <br>

                <i>White Phosphorus Round:</i> This round creates smoke cover. It has a range of 50 to 4400 meters and burns for two minutes at 2700 degrees C. It can send out smoke to either mark a target for other attacks, as a signal, or to provide cover for an attack by smoking up the target area. </p>
