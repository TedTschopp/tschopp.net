                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Forest Home lies to the North of Haven next to and within a densely forested area.  It is a lovely, large, three-story home that was built in the Bavarian style often associated with Hansel and Gretel.  Though it is obviously ancient, it has been beautifully preserved.  On your arrival here, you went into the main room.  In that common room was a group of 5 - 10 people eating dinner.  Bokshee, saw this and escorted the party outside to camp out s the party was too large.  While in the inn you saw a large painting on wall.
